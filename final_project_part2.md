# TSWD Final Project Part II – Asian Quota in Ivy League College Admission
 
In Part I of this final project, I decided to redesign the visualization that Ron Uniz used in his article. 
Also, I plan to tell the story of Asian Quota in Ivy League Colleges from my perspective.
 
For the second part of this project, I first made a wireframe and conducted user research. 
Following that, I revised my outline of this project and edited my wireframe based on the comments from my interviews.
 
## Revised Outline
 
1.	Elite College Enrollment of Asian Students dropped while the population increased
2.	Battle of College Admission Caused by Wealth Imbalance
3.	Asian Americans are the New Jews
4.	Estimating Asian Merit
5.	Jewish Enrollment at Harvard
6.	The Silent Asian
7.	Call of Action
 
## Initial Wireframe
 
## Research Protocol
 
### Target audience

Since I am planning to raise awareness about education equality by telling a story on the imbalanced college admission. 
My target audience would be people who care about education and especially Asians who live in the United States.
More specifically, a majority of my target audience would be international students 
who plan to live and work in the United States after their graduation. 
The reason is that it would be easier to motivate educated audience about the issue they should care about. 
I hope I can help more people be aware of the inequality around us and motivate 
the silent audience to speak for themselves and their children in the future.
 
### Approach to identify representative individuals to interview
 
My approach to selecting interviewees is straightforward. 
Because Heinz is a diversified college, there are many international students with different backgrounds. 
When I conducted the interview, I walked around in the collaboration space next to A301 
and randomly asked people to take my interview.
