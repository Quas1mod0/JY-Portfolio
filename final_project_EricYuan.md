# TSWD Final Project Proposal - Asian Quota in Ivy League College Admission
## Summary

In 2012, an article wrote by Ron Uniz indicates that there is an Ivy League Asian quota. 
However, the data visualization in his article can be improved. In this project, 
I will redesign the data visualization and investigate the current condition of this issue after the article was published.

## Outline 

1. The factors behind the battle of college admission
2. The story of the battle of college admission
3. There used to be a jewish quota
4. The Asian quota
5. 2012 - An article that raised social awareness
6. The current condition

## Initial sketches

In the original data visualization, Uniz used a line chart to show the trend of Asian enrollment by Ivy League schools. 
The y-axis and the x-axis represent the percentage of Asian Student enrollment and year, respectively. 
Since there are eight schools and Uniz gave each school a unique color, the chart looks crowded. 
Also, he used another y-axis to indicate the growth of the Asian American population. 
The table looks crowded, and it takes time to interpret. 

When I was redesigning the chart, I tried to keep the information still in one visualization 
without making each category overlap each other visually. Therefore, I decided to let y-axis 
to be different universities and let x-axis to represent time. 
I will use a similar color scheme to differentiate schools and use 
the size of the circle to show the change in the percentage of Asian admission.

## The Data
The 
[National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov)
receives the racial enrollment data from American universities each year. 
In this publicly available website, we can find the necessary data for each university of interest. 
I will keep exploring this database to find more recent data. 
Also, I will search for data that shows the trend of the American population in different races.

## Method and Medium
For now, I am planning to use shorthand to write a story for this final project. For each element listed in the outline section, I will create a page on shorthand with a couple paragraphs of explanation and some pitures and visualiztions to increase the engagement of the audience. I will explore the use of other data visualization tools as I dive deeper into more data.
