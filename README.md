Welcome to my online portfolio! I will show you the most interesting projects I built through out the course of Telling Story with Data.

## About Me

Hello! I'm Eric, a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. I am a second-year graduate student at the Heinz College's Public Policy and Management program. Before coming to Pittsburgh, I went to California for undergraduate study, I majored in Math with a minor in Social Psychology. I am planning to be a consultant after I finish the study at Heinz. The reason is that I find meeting different people from various industries fascinating. Also, being a consultant will push me to keep learning about new business, people, and innovations around the globe. I  think keep learning is the best way to stay young.

## What I hope to learn

In this class, I hope to learn more skills to be a more convincing presenter. My greatest satisfaction of doing projects at Heinz is when I give an excellent presentation and receive the recognition from the audience. With the experience at Heinz, I learned the importance of a clear, concise, and informative PowerPoint or report. Hence, I take the opportunity of my last year at Heinz to strengthen my data visualization skills continuously. I hope I can be more convincing, more effective at attracting my audience and express my idea at the end of the course.
