When I first read this data visualization, it made sense to me, and the information conveyed was direct and effective. The first thing that came to my mind was black women and women above 40 years old are the maximums of their groups. Using black font color for the maximums and grey for the rest groups is very useful for emphasizing important information visually. However, later I found the bars are arranged in the order of death number instead of death rate (bar length). Then I decided to remake the visualization to make the data have a unified order and convey information more effectively.

In the draft of my visualization, I first arranged the bars with a descending order of death rate. In this way, Black Women came to the top of the graph so that readers will read it first. I kept the light blue color scheme for Black since I found it not offending. But I made the rest of the bars grey to emphasize the focus further. I also created a bar chart for the death numbers to show a simple message: Black Women have second-highest pregnancy death number. In this way, I think the visualization will not confuse the audience about how the chart's order. Then, I made a similar arrangement for the lower half of the original data visualization.

After that, I showed my draft to some of my classmates. Popular feedback was that the original subtitle was not direct enough. They suggest me to write a more clear message title to tell the readers the point I am trying to make. So I edited the subtitle with the most critical insight of this visualization. Then I re-evaluate my draft with the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. I found that there is too much excessive information. As a reader, I didn't find the comparison among age groups necessary. Thus, I deleted the bar chart for age groups and made the visualization in Tableau.
