# TSWD Final Project Part III â€“ Asian Quota in Ivy League College Admission

## Project Plan

For this project, I decided to tell the story about how Asian students are treated unequally during the college application process for some elite universities. The are four parts of this final project: outline, draft, web page design, and presentation.

The following is the detailed project plan:

### [Part III The Web Page Design](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/TSWDEY/index.html)

I am taking the Poverty, Inequality, and Human Rights class this semester. Through reading and studying for that policy course, I started to learn more about things that happen in other places around the globe. Reading about stories and history about inequality always makes me feel small since there is little I can do. Fortunately, I also learned to care about more. So I decided to start from the world around me. Then I decided to tell a story about the educational inequality that Asian students face when they apply for the best American College.

At first, I was aiming to inform more individuals that share similar cultural backgrounds with me. I wanted to help them be aware of the possible inequality they might encounter. But as the work continues, I realize that I should not limit the call of action to a specific group of people. Therefore, I tried to encourage everyone to care about the policies that are important to them and express their feelings bravely.

During phase one of this project, I came up with an outline and decided to use beeswarm plot for the data visualization. I wanted to use the size of the radius to represent the proportion of Asian enrollment in elite colleges since I thought the original line charts show too much information for readers to process it quickly. 
For the second phase, I designed and conducted research and interview to get some thoughts and comments about my wireframe. The insights are helpful. I learned that I should not expect the audience to have a similar thought process like me. Instead, I should try to anticipate their reaction and then design my project and data visualization.

However, when I started actually to design the shorthand page, it turned out that there was still too much information due to a large number of schools. Also, it is hard to show the actual numbers without labeling the circles, but it will make the chart looks messy with all the labels. Hence, I decided to reduce the number of schools I show in a line chart. And I used a different color scheme to emphasize Harvard, the example that I used in my article. I hope it will help the readers easily understand the general trend of decreasing Asian enrollment in elite colleges.

For the Asian Admission section, I decided to use a table to show the weight of Asian enrollment from 2007 to 2011. The reason is that I think numbers sometimes can convey information most directly and effectively. Combing with the scroll feature of shorthand, I used grey for all the other racial group data and made the data for Asian students bold and black. I choose the simplest way to show the trend because I want it will be readable for everyone.

 I learned in this class is that if we can apply techniques like choosing the right color scheme, and add animations, the most common visualizations like line charts and bar charts can be very effective for communicating with readers. Also, it always helps to show my drafts to friends for some feedback. It is hard for me to anticipate the reaction from the audience, so it is more efficient to conduct research.
